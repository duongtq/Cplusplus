**About**

Here are some projects I have made to learn Spring framework and its components.

**How to run**

You simply clone what project you are interested in and run it normally. I personally recommend using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate to run these projects.
Some of my projects have a Dockerfile for those who want to Dockerize the application. Enjoy~~
